        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>I've always been incredibly passionate about web development and creating my own projects. From a young age, I marveled at the endless possibilities the digital world offered, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. However, despite my enthusiasm, I must admit that I've faced my fair share of challenges in staying committed to learning the basics.</p>
        <p>I've dabbled in coding and web development multiple times, but life often got in the way, and I found myself easily distracted by other pursuits. The excitement of starting a new project was always there, but I struggled to maintain the discipline needed to truly grasp the fundamentals. It was as if I had a drawer full of brilliant project ideas, waiting to be brought to life, but the key to unlock my full potential had somehow eluded me.</p>
        <p>But today, I stand more determined than ever to change that narrative. I've come to realize that my passion for web development is too powerful to let it remain unfulfilled. I am finally ready to embark on this journey with unwavering commitment. I'm ready to immerse myself in the world of coding, to build a strong foundation in web development, and to turn those brilliant project ideas into reality.</p>
