        <h2>Personal Background</h2>
        <p>I've always been incredibly passionate about web development and creating my own projects. From a young age, I marveled at the endless possibilities the digital world offered, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. However, despite my enthusiasm, I must admit that I've faced my fair share of challenges in staying committed to learning the basics.</p>
        <p>In the past, life's distractions often led me away from coding. Despite the excitement of new projects, maintaining discipline proved challenging. It felt like I had a drawer full of brilliant ideas waiting to be brought to life, but unlocking my full potential eluded me.</p>
        <p>Today, I'm determined to change that narrative. Realizing my passion for web development is too strong to go unfulfilled, I'm ready to commit. I'm prepared to immerse myself in coding, build a strong foundation, and turn those brilliant ideas into reality.</p>
